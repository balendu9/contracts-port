Deploy mock tokens, DEXes, a flash loan provider, and the arbitrage contract on testnet.
Python script simulates price discrepancies by adjusting liquidity on the DEXes (via transactions).
Python triggers the arbitrage contract, which takes a flash loan, executes trades, repays, and logs results.
Simulate cycles: Randomly vary liquidity, track metrics (success rate, profits, slippage), and handle risks (e.g., revert on insufficient profit).
